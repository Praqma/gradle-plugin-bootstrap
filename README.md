# Gradle Plugin bootstrap

This project is all the scaffolding you need to get up and running with custom Gradle plugin development.
Feel free to clone it and tweak it to easily create your own plugin.

## More information

I wrote a [post on Praqma.com](http://www.praqma.com/stories/gradle-plugin-bootstrap) that goes into more detail on various parts of the plugin.
Check it out if you want more information, including on how to publish and distribute your plugin.

Note that since writing the blog post, I've cleaned up my use of the `com.jfrog.artifactory` plugin.
The configuration is less verbose for Maven-only projects without it, really.
Either way, enjoy!
